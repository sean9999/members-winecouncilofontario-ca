In 2000, owner and winemaker Catherine&nbsp;Langlois planted Riesling, Cabernet Franc and the&nbsp;French hybrids Mar&eacute;chal Foch and Vidal. The largest&nbsp;planting is her now-signature Baco Noir. While her&nbsp;award-winning Riesling and Cabernet Franc show&nbsp;charm and class, it&rsquo;s her Baco and Foch Reserve that&nbsp;have earned a loyal following. Sandbanks celebrates&nbsp;its 10th anniversary with a new wine boutique,&nbsp;contemporary art gallery and tasting room, along&nbsp;with a season packed with lively events.</p>', 'sandbanks.jpg', '', '2', '17598 Loyalist Parkway', 'Wellington', 'K0K 3L0', 'http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Sandbanks+Estate+Winery,+Prince+Edward,+Ontario+K0K+3L0,+Canada&hl=en&cd=1&ei=49ATTI6wE6q8yATFloXEAQ&sll=43.937585,-77.416019&sspn=0.036931,0.057549&ie=UTF8&view=map&cid=12760723933741491416&ved=0CEIQpQY&hq=Sandbanks+Estate+Winery,+Prince+Edward,+Ontario+K0K+3L0,+Canada&hnear=&ll=43.938142,-77.416019&spn=0.00968,0.013272&z=17&iwloc=A', 'Mayâ€“Dec.,\r\nDaily 10 a.m.â€“6 p.m.\r\nFeb.â€“Apr.,\r\nSat.â€“Sun. 10:30 a.m.â€“5 p.m.', 'Self-guided or by appointment', '613-399-1839', 'www.sandbankswinery.com', 'wine@sandbankswinery.com', '0', 'Cabernet Franc', 'Baco Noir', 'Catherine Langlois', '');
